Description: BudgetIV provides a tuneable and interpretable method for relaxing 
	the instrumental variables (IV) assumptions to infer treatment effects in the presence
	of unobserved confounding.
	For a pre-treatment covariate to be a valid IV, it must be (a) unconfounded with the outcome
	and (b) have a causal effect on the outcome that is exclusively mediated by the exposure. 
	It is impossible to test the validity of these IV assumptions for any particular pre-treatment 
	covariate; however, when different pre-treatment covariates give differing causal effect estimates 
	if treated as IVs, then we know at least one of the covariates violates these assumptions. 
	BudgetIV exploits this fact by taking as input a minimum ``budget'' of pre-treatment covariates assumed
	to be valid IVs. 
	This can be extended to assuming a set of budgets for varying ``degrees'' of validity set by the user and 
	defined formally through a parameter that captures violation of either IV assumption. 
	These budget constraints can be chosen using specialist knowledge or varied in a principled sensitivity analysis.
	BudgetIV is a package supports non-linear treatment effects and multi-dimensional treatments; requires only summary 
	statistics rather than raw data; and can be used to construct confidence sets under a standard assumption from the 
	Mendelian randomisation literature.
